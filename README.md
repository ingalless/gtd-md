# GTD Markdown

## Why?

I want a tool that works the way I want to work with tasks.
It should be a terminal application based on a folder of markdown files.

## Design Philosophies

- Support the principles from Getting Things Done (that I personally implement) such as the inbox, next actions, and the "tickler"
- Actions should based on markdown. Create a file per action to enable capturing extra information
- TUI + CLI (e.g. `gtd action "I need to make this app"`
- Use `$EDITOR` to capture details
