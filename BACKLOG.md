# Backlog

## Next Actions

- Make it possible to capture actions
    - There should be an md file per to-do so that extra information can be captured (`gtd actions add`, or `gtd a a`)
    - They should be listable (`gtd actions ls` or similar)

## Someday/Maybe

- Terminal User Interface
- Git sync
